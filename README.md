# AstroNews

A modern NLP-powered application for analyzing and exploring space news articles. AstroNews leverages state-of-the-art embedding models to provide deep semantic understanding of textual content.

## üöÄ Features

* **Semantic Search**: Find articles based on meaning and context, not just keywords.
* **Article Clustering**: Automatically group similar news articles together.
* **Content Summarization**:  Get the gist of an article without reading the whole text.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Language**: Python
* **Core Libraries**:
  * `transformers`: For accessing and using state-of-the-art NLP models.
  * `torch` / `tensorflow`: As the backend for the transformer models.
  * `scikit-learn`: For machine learning tasks like clustering.
  * `pandas`: For efficient data manipulation.
* **Embedding Model**: `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for generating high-quality sentence embeddings.
